This repository is dedicated to recording my journey of mastering data structures and algorithms. Each solution is implemented with a focus on code quality, efficiency, and structured documentation.

## Repository Structure
To maintain a clean and structured environment, problems are organized by their primary tags or data structures.

```text
.
├── Array/                  # Array & Strings
├── Dynamic-Programming/    # DP problems
├── Tree/                   # Binary Tree, BST, etc.
├── Graph/                  # DFS, BFS, Union-Find
├── Linked-List/            # Pointer manipulations
├── Template/               # Reusable code templates (Binary Search, etc.)
└── README.md               # Main documentation
```

Each problem folder contains:
* `Solution.java`: The source code.
* `Notes.md`: Breakdown of the logic, time/space complexity, and lessons learned.

## Environment & Tools
* **Language**: Java 21
* **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
* **Environment**: Miniconda (Used to manage specific build tools or script-based helpers)
* **Version Control**: Git

### Workflow
1. **Analyze**: Understand the problem and constraints.
2. **Sketch**: Write down the pseudocode and complexity.
3. **Implement**: Write clean, modular code.
4. **Refactor**: Optimize for performance or readability.
5. **Document**: Update the `Notes.md` and the progress table.
